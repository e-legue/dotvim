documentation:

add support to simple quote into description. workaround : see indent with "inner block" in vim.xml, section indent.

add support of mapping for bundle page. need to include file in xslt of bundle.xml.
I do some of this. I am able to load [bundle-name].xml file if it exists. Now I should import xslt. That means I need to isolate the right portion of code from xsl/vim.xsl and import this file in the two xsl.

improve UI: 
- limiting width of first column Command. 
- deleting scrollbar.
