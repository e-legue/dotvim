Installation:

  git clone https://github.com/e-legue/dotvim.git ~/.vim

Create symlinks:

  ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
  ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc (optional, as I haven't specific gui env)

Switch to the `~/.vim` directory, and fetch submodules:

  cd ~/.vim
  git submodule init
  git submodule update

To be able to custom your config, without modifying git files, you can 
create a file named personal_config.vim - This file is called at the
end of .vimrc, if it exists.
Thus you have a place to override "standart" definitions, or add your 
own preferences, as the colorscheme for exemple.
